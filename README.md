### Hi there 👋

I am Ruben 👨🏻‍💻, a developer from Barcelona. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building a showtimes aggregator for Barcelona using a mix of Python (crawling) Scala (api) and React for the Frontend
- 🌱 I’m currently improving my Golang skills by replicating GNU Coreutils.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything Python/Golang related.
- 📈 I like data analysis. Python and Pandas is a winning combo, but I am also intrigued by Julia.
