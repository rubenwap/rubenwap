### Hi there 👋

I am Ruben 👨🏻‍💻, a developer from Barcelona. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building a showtimes aggregator for Barcelona. 
- 🌱 I’m currently improving my Golang skills and learning a bit of Elixir on the side, because functional programming is cool, despite the fact that my first experience with Scala was slow and painful.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything Python/Golang related.
- 📈 I like data analysis. We all already know that Python and Pandas is a winning combo, so I am also intrigued by Julia.
